## Books

* An Introduction to Statistical Learning with Applications in R (ISLR)
    + Focused on applying statistical learning
    + Our primary book for the meetups
    + Available at http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/ISL/
* The Elements of Statistical Learning (ESL)
    + Provides the theory
    + We may use this for some deeper dives
    + Available at http://statweb.stanford.edu/~tibs/ElemStatLearn/
    
## Getting and Using R

* Download and install R
    + https://www.cran.r-project.org
* Download and install RStudio
    + https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/

## Why R?

* Because ISLR!
* I believe it's the best environment for learning the concepts of machine learning
  + R + RStudio are free and open source and easy to use
* Concepts can be *directly* applied to other environments, particularly Python
* We're all programmers and my experience tells me you won't have a problem with learning R!

## Modern R

* Hadley Wickham, "The Hadleyverse"
    + ggplot2
    + dplyr
    + tidyr

## Learning R

* Data Computing
    + http://data-computing.org
* Covers modern R!

```{r, out.width = 300, fig.retina = NULL}
knitr::include_graphics("images/front-cover.png")
```

## Learning R

* R in Action
    + https://www.manning.com/books/r-in-action-second-edition

```{r, out.width = 300, fig.retina = NULL}
knitr::include_graphics("images/RinActionCover.jpg")
```

## Goals of the Data Science Meetup

* Have fun!
    + Forum for taking risks
* Learn about the topic of machine learning
* ISLR is not the end

## Structure of the Data Science Meetup

* Structured sessions
    + Interaction encouraged
* Presentations availble on BMC github
    + Available on BMC github
* Regular sessions and will be recorded
* Labs
    + Volunteer to present?
* Open ended

## Introduction to Statistical Learning

```{r, out.width = 600, fig.retina = NULL}
knitr::include_graphics("images/plots.png")
```

## Exploring Data

* Quantitative/continuous values
    + Age
    + Wage
* Qualitative/categorical values
    + Education level
    + Stock movement (up, down)
    + Low, medium, high (ordered categorical)

## History of Statistical Learning

* Method of Least Squares
    + Legendre, Gauss beginning 19th century
    + Basis of linear regression
    + Predict quantitative values
* Linear Discriminant Analysis
    + Fisher, 1936
    + Predict qualitative values
* Logistic Regression
    + Various, 1940's
    + Alternative to LDA
* Generalized Linear Models
    + Nelder and Wedderburn, early 1970's

## ISLR Premises

* Many statistical learning methods are relevant and useful in a wide
range of academic and non-academic disciplines, beyond just the statistical
sciences
* Statistical learning should not be viewed as a series of black boxes
* While it is important to know what job is performed by each cog, it
is not necessary to have the skills to construct the machine inside the
box!
* We presume that the reader is interested in applying statistical learning
methods to real-world problems
