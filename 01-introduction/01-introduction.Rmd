## Books

* An Introduction to Statistical Learning with Applications in R (ISLR)
    + Focused on applying statistical learning
    + Our primary book for the meetups
    + Available at http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/ISL/
* The Elements of Statistical Learning (ESL)
    + Provides the theory
    + We may use this for some deeper dives
    + Available at http://statweb.stanford.edu/~tibs/ElemStatLearn/
    
## Getting and Using R

## Exploring Data

* Quantitative/continuous values
    + Age
    + Wage
* Qualitative/categorical values
    + Education level
    + Stock movement (up, down)
    + Low, medium, high (ordered categorical)

## History of Statistical Learning

* Method of Least Squares
    + Legendre, Gauss beginning 19th century
    + Basis of linear regression
    + Predict quantitative values
* Linear Discriminant Analysis
    + Fisher, 1936
    + Predict qualitative values
* Logistic Regression
    + Various, 1940's
    + Alternative to LDA
* Generalized Linear Models
    + Nelder and Wedderburn, early 1970's

## ISLR Premises

* Many statistical learning methods are relevant and useful in a wide
range of academic and non-academic disciplines, beyond just the statistical
sciences
* Statistical learning should not be viewed as a series of black boxes
* While it is important to know what job is performed by each cog, it
is not necessary to have the skills to construct the machine inside the
box!
* We presume that the reader is interested in applying statistical learning
methods to real-world problems
